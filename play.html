        Taming of the Shrews
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Act 1, Scene 1: Padua. A public place - The Taming of the Shrew is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1590 and 1592.
        The play begins with a framing device, often referred to as the induction, in which a mischievous nobleman tricks a drunken tinker named Christopher Sly into believing he is actually a nobleman himself.

    <p class="stage-direction">Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO</p>
    <p>
        <h8 class="name">LUCENTIO</h8>
        <p class="LUCENTIO">
            Tranio, since for the great desire I had
            To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
            I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
            The pleasant garden of great Italy;
            And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
            With his good will and thy good company,
            My trusty servant, well approved in all,
            Here let us breathe and haply institute
            A course of learning and ingenious studies.
            Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
            Gave me my being and my father first,
            A merchant of great traffic through the world,
            Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
            Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
            It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
            To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
            And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
            Virtue and that part of philosophy
            Will I apply that treats of happiness
            By virtue specially to be achieved.
            Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
            And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
            A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
            And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
        </p>
        <h8 class="name">TRANIO</h8>
        <p class="TRANIO">
            Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
            I am in all affected as yourself;
            Glad that you thus continue your resolve
            To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
            Only, good master, while we do admire
            This virtue and this moral discipline,
            Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
            Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
            As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
            Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
            And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
            Music and poesy use to quicken you;
            The mathematics and the metaphysics,
            Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
            No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
            In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
        </p>
        <h8 class="name">LUCENTIO</h8>
        <p class="LUCENTIO">
            Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
            If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
            We could at once put us in readiness,
            And take a lodging fit to entertain
            Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
            But stay a while: what company is this? </p>
        <h8 class="name">TRANIO</h8>
          <p class="TRANIO"> Master, some show to welcome us to town.
        </p>
        <p class="stage-direction">
            Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by
        </p>
        <h8 class="name">BAPTISTA</h8>
        <p class="BAPTISTA">
            Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
            For how I firmly am resolved you know;
            That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
            Before I have a husband for the elder:
            If either of you both love Katharina,
            Because I know you well and love you well,
            Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
        </p>
        <h8 class="name">GREMIO</h8>
        <p class="GREMIO">
            [Aside] To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.
            There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?
        </p>
        <h8 class="name">KATHARINA</h8>
        <p class="KATHARINA">
            I pray you, sir, is it your will
            To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
        </p>
        <h8 class="name">HORTENSIO</h8>
        <p class="HORTENSIO">
            Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
            Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
        </p>
        <h8 class="name">KATHARINA</h8>
        <p class="KATHARINA">
            I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
            I wis it is not half way to her heart;
            But if it were, doubt not her care should be
            To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
            And paint your face and use you like a fool.
